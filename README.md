**Visualizing the gradient magnitudes in context, can be a powerful tool to
see when recurrent units use short-term or long-term memorization.**

1. Run `npm install`
2. Train the models with `make train`. This will take a very long time :)
3. Build the data for the article with `make build`
4. Bundle the article JavaScript with `make bundle`
5. Run the article server with `make server`

Alternatively, if you just want to render and show the article:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
